    "foodHabitTypeDefinition" : "Any animal that sustains itself solely on meat is classified as a carnivore. Carnivores often have sharper teeth or even fangs to help tear up flesh. Most of the time in their ecosystem, carnivores will prey on herbivores though they may eat omnivores or even other carnivores depending on what food is available. Small carnivores can include spiders, frogs and bats. Medium-size carnivores might include larger birds, such as eagles and hawks, snakes, and anteaters. Large carnivores range from wild dogs and wolves to large predators like lions, tigers or crocodiles."

    "foodHabitTypeDefinition" : "Any animal that eats only plants will be classified as an herbivore. Just because they don't eat meat doesn't mean all herbivores are small. Guinea pigs, rabbits, snails and butterflies are all good examples of small herbivores, but horses, cows, zebras, deer and elephants are herbivores, as well. In prehistoric times, many dinosaurs ate only plants and they reached gigantic proportions. Many different types of animals can be herbivores, including mammals, insects, worms, invertebrates and even some birds."
